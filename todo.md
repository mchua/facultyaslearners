The goal is small, readable versions of everything but the discussion; write something small and readable, then expand and iterate as far as you can.

------

- [x] Results: look at those outlines with fresher eyes and make sure every claim has solid argumentative backing; if not, scratch it.
- [x] Results: type the surviving claims in full sentences with expanded abbreviations into outlines of the results section.
- [ ] Methods: look at the methods questions, and write a 1-paragraph (longer only if needed) answer to each -- you now have that first little version of the methods section. 
- [ ] Lit review, postmodern: Turn each of the four tools into an action phrase; find examples of each usage in the results, and write a 1-paragraph description of each tool, with a "for-instance" example sentence. Make sure you have an "intro to postmodernism" section and a "where this shows up in engineering education" section, and that's it -- you now have that first little version.
- [ ] Lit review, narrative: Take a break and look at Todd and Lindsey's feedback offline first; you are probably extremely close to a small version if you cut a lot -- do it!
- [ ] Lit review, faculty as learners: Looking at Todd and Sebastian's documents, write an outline down on paper -- use post-its if you need to. Now write a paragraph for each item in the outline. You now have that first little version.
- [] Results: expand the outlines into things that look like blog posts; you now have a first little version.

------

- [ ] Results: find and copy-paste the data snippets I have specified as evidence for each claim (right now they're written as things like "Mark's quote about how students can't give well-informed curricular feedback" -- it's specific, it's there somewhere, I need to text-search to find it and snip it in)
- [ ] Results: type the warrants for each data snippet -- again, they're in longhand outline form, but need to be expanded and I suspect might shift and expand even more once I'm staring at the appropriate data snippet.
- [ ] Methods: one paragraph on each of the validity criteria from Glassick and Lather, and one paragraph on how I've fulfilled each of those criteria.
- [ ] Methods: go through the (printed-out) version of the methods section; if any paragraph fits into an existing tiny draft paragraph, then go ahead and put it in the right place. You know you'll need to edit the "how I analyzed stuff" section into past-tense and rip out the analysis parts you didn't actually do.
- [ ] Methods: each narrator's self-intro from their first interview copy-pasted into the appropriate location.
- [ ] Methods/Litrev: Look at handwritten notes from readings and put them in the right dissertation chapter.
