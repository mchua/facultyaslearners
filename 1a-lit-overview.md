Prior work: tools to think with
==================================

Overview
------------

This section presents a more in-depth view of three areas where we can employ prior literature as "tools to think with" for the topic of faculty as learners. The three areas are poststructuralism/postmodernism, narrative, and the community and culture of academic practice.

In the introduction, we discussed how faculty learn within liminal experiences. We will look at the tools poststructuralism and postmodernism offer us for understanding and disrupting our existing views of faculty as learners.

Our discussion of poststructuralism and postmodernism will lead us outside the conventional bounds of scholarly practice and format. At that point, we'll take a brief interlude to discuss what "scholarship" and "validity" mean in the context of this work as a poststructural/postmodern work, and how you can assess this work.

We will then turn to the literature on narration and examine storytelling and narrative analysis/methodology in the context of poststructural/postmodern thinking. 

Finally, we will look at the nature of stories in community and how literature on situated learning helps inform our view of faculty as learners in a shared context with other faculty. As part of this, we will explore a few key aspects of their context (engineering/technology education and higher education) and the historical forces their contexts have been shaped within.
