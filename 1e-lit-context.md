(This section will expand on the communal context of faculty members as learners, including looking at historical conceptions of their roles and how those concepts fit into situated and communal learning theories such as the community of practice and cognitive apprenticeship frameworks.)

### What is a faculty member?

In order to understand faculty as learners, we must first examine what a faculty member is, and how their roles are positioned within the academic world they work in. AAUP, the American Association of University Professors, defines faculty members as "members of the instructional-research staff who are employed full time... [and] whose major regular assignment (at least 50 percent) is instruction, including release time for research." (AAUP, 2015) Faculty on sabbatical are counted; temporary  replacements for faculty on paid leave are not counted. Part-time employees, administative officers such as librarians, deans, or coaches, and graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants are not counted. Notably, the AAUP defines faculty roles by function, not by title; anyone fitting that definition is included regardless of whether their formal institutional title is "faculty."
 
From this definition, we see that faculty job duties include, but are not limited to, the instruction of postsecondary students. In the case of engineering and technology faculty, this role specifically includes formation of engineering and technology students. In the current dominant model of the American university, this includes direct classroom experience and contact with students, some degree of autonomy regarding how to teach them, and the expectation of an intellectual life outside the classroom.

### Humboldt's vision for the professorate

This model for the life of the professorate comes to us from Wilhelm von Humboldt’s vision for the university, the 19th century “Bildungsideal” (literally, "higher-education-ideal"). The dual and symbiotic roles of teacher-scholar, the concept of academic freedom, and the autonomy to teach one’s classroom as one wishes all come from Humboldt’s views on the Enlightenment. (Humboldt, YYYY) His intent was to create vital and thinking citizens of the world, allowing individuals to develop themselves in an environment of intellectual freedom.
