The "for the students" metanarrative limits our view of faculty learning.

The metanarrative is: faculty make the curriculum for the students. This creates a separation between "faculty," "curriculum," and "students," and places them in specific roles in relation to each other: faculty are makers of curriculum, students are recipients of curriculum, and the curriculum is something that is created by and applied to someone or something other than itself.
