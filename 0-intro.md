Faculty are learners, too
----------------------------

We often think of engineering and technology faculty as teachers. As facilitators of student learning, they hold philosophies about teaching, learning, and the nature of student/faculty roles. These philosophies shape their interactions in the classroom. However, faculty are also learners themselves. Among other things, they are students of the practice of teaching and curriculum development for engineering and technology.

As engineering education researchers concerned with research-to-practice transfer, the ways we think about faculty-as-learners likewise shape the ways we try to impact their practice. Making this thinking more visible within the engineering/technology domain is of interest to engineering and technology faculty. Specifically, making faculty more visible as learners can help us recognize and reward faculty engaging in learning experiences that fall outside current evaluation processes.

During the course of this project, I have employed postmodern and poststructural lens to challenge our perspectives on faculty-as-learners. Postmodernism and poststructuralism ("post*") are paradigms that constantly seek a "making-strange" and unsettling of habitual narratives. A post* view challenges us to remain in the discomfort of liminal (in-between) spaces where everything is constantly troubled and nothing ever really settles. This study demonstrates a concrete method for engaging faculty members in that liminal space. Through it, I contribute to our ability to articulate and value faculty explorations in chaotic territories such as large-scale curriculum redesigns, new program formation, and other places where valuable growth occurs but is rarely put into words.

How can we think of faculty as learners?
------------------------------------------

In this section, I will briefly describe several qualities of faculty-as-learners, compare and contrast them to the qualities presented in existing literature, and explore why it may be valuable to make these qualities visible. Note that by comparing and contrasting my approach to other studies, I am not making statements about the relative quality or validity of their work. I am also not saying that these ways of viewing faculty-as-learners are not present in any existing literature. I am simply using differences and similarities to more clearly articulate certain assumptions about faculty-as-learners that are present in this project.

The first quality of faculty-as-learners is that they often learn by engaging in liminal experiences. Liminal experiences are characterized by activities that do not fall into a cleanly articulable structure; they can therefore be described as poststructural. In fact, the liminal experiences of faculty are often explicitly about dismantling old structures and remaking new ones, such as the founding of a new college (S. Kerns, Miller, & D. Kerns, 2005) or degree program (Katehi et. al., 2004), dramatic overhauls of an existing curriculum (Mentkowski, 2000), or the creation of experimental classes.

The trouble with liminal experiences is that they stand outside the realm of structure, including the structure of validation and reward. Our existing academic system rewards faculty for engaging in liminal spaces for their research, so long as they are able to publish papers about it afterwards. However, the examples listed all impact teaching, a form of scholarship that is underdeveloped and unrecognized (Shulman, 1998), with a correspondingly slow speed of change. New faculty are explicitly taught strategies to minimize the time spent on teaching by bounding its uncertainty and tightly controlling their engagment in liminal teaching spaces (LIST NEW FACULTY BOOKS HERE).

This incentive structure for avoiding curricular experimentation stands in tension alongside a long-time call for innovation in engineering education. Mann’s (1918) calls for engineering educators to improve student retention, make undergraduate workloads reasonable, and increase hands-on training still sound as relevant today as when he wrote his report nearly a century ago. Our calls for transforming engineering education (National Academy of Engineering, 2005; Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, & National Academy of Engineering, 2007; McKenna, 2011) will similarly go unheeded unless we find ways to understand and articulate the ways faculty learn and work in these liminal spaces.

The second quality of faculty-as-learners is that they are narrators. Faculty members are adult learners, with rich histories of experience to draw upon as well as expectations of agency (Vella, 1997). As narrators, they are highly capable and interdependent agents who both read and co-author the stories of “how things are done” within their culture. Furthermore, they 

The Disciplinary Commons initiative (Tenenberg & Fincher, 2007), which scaffolds faculty through a dialogic process of creating teaching portfolios for their existing courses, is an exemplar of validating faculty as adult
learners. Initiatives that treat faculty as mere empty “buckets” to be filled with “information about teaching,” such as information sessions dedicated to lecturing faculty about why they should not lecture, may have a limited impact because of this epistemological disjoint.

The third quality of faculty-as-learners is that they are situated in a community of practice (Wenger, 1999), that of teaching their discipline. By making sense of the activities of other practitioners around them, they develop the skill of reflection-in-action (Schön, 1983) and use this metacognition and self-monitoring to improve their own practice. Existing engineering education change initiatives have used this cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Brown, & Newman, 1987; Collins, Brown, & Holum, 1991) approach to build Faculty Learning Communities (Cox, 2004) and
other communities of practice to encourage rigorous research in engineering education (Streveler, Smith, & Miller, 2005). 

Understanding faculty as situated and communal learners helps explain the limited success of an “information dissemination” approach (Siddiqui and Adams, 2013) to research-to-practice transfer. If faculty change their teaching practice primarily in response to direct interactions with colleagues (Fincher, Richards, Finlay, Sharp, & Falconer, 2012) and not print materials, it’s no surprise that journal papers continue to go unread (Borrego, Froyd, & Hall, 2010).

Research question
-----------------------

By diving alongside engineering and technology faculty with/in their stories of liminal experiences in curricular development, I address the following research question: How can the interacting narratives of engineering and technology faculty inform our understanding of faculty as learners?
