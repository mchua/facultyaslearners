Curricular design is for, by, and of the faculty.

This blurs the distinction between the faculty-self and the curriculum-world.

Surgeon story
----------------
A story may be useful to illustrate this point. Imagine a group of surgeons designing medical equipment They will be using this equipment to perform a certain surgery on a large population of patients. The patients are certainly stakeholders in the equipment design, and their values and needs must be taken into account. For example, the scalpel needs to be sharp and long enough to cut through the right tissues in the human population undergoing surgery; it can't be designed for a mouse or an elephant. Additionally, the operating table needs to be long enough for tall patients to lie down, and sturdy enough to hold heavy patients. Surgical drapes should be designed to account for the patients' cultural values of modesty, and so forth.

However, it would be strange to require all design decisions to be justified solely in terms of patient benefit. Imagine what would happen if the surgeons said “We need the scalpel to be controllable by both left and right-handed people...  because some of the patients are left-handed.” The surgeons are controlling the scalpel, not the patients. The scalpel may indeed need to work for both left-handed and right-handed surgeons, but that's because there are left-handed surgeons – not because there are left-handed patients.

Both surgeon and patient needs and values need to be taken into account when designing the medical equipment. The operating table needs to adjust to the height and girth of the patient, but it also needs to adjust to the height and reach of the doctor. Surgical drapes need to account for patient privacy while giving surgeons access to the body parts they will be working on. It may be useful to see surgeons as a different type of user group than patients, but they are both users. Furthermore, some people may belong to both user groups; some surgeons may also undergo the surgery.

Similarly, while students are users of curriculum, they are not the only users. Faculty  also experience their own curricular designs/environments, and have needs and values that inevitably end up shaping the curricular design, whether we admit it or not.

By the faculty
------------------
The idea of curriculum being "by the faculty" is already part of the metanarrative.

For the faculty
------------------

DATA: 130 as a facdev opportunity

DATA: Stuff of History as "let's do this together"

Mark's anecdote brings up another point: far from only being designers of curricula, faculty also learners themselves. Mark's story about the “thick skin” portrays him as a faculty learner in a context outside of curricular design, namely in the summer leadership institute he had attended. However, faculty are also learners in the context of the curriculum they are designing. Gary illustrates this point:

GARY 3: So, team teaching, that was a big piece to figure out what people understood and what their hot buttons were, and what they felt was the most important pieces, and how to negotiate that to then come up with the best content for the students. (92)

The end goal is to create “the best content for the students.” However, in order to do this, the faculty need to learn several things for themselves. Faculty need to “figure out” things about each other, learn things about their colleagues' triggers and values, and learn negotiation skills. Their needs, values, and learning must  also be taken into account – something the metanarrative of “for the students” ignores.

Faculty may also want to learn from and work with certain colleagues; the phrase “we should do something together,” spoken either in a research or a teaching context, refers first to the desire of faculty members to learn – and only secondarily to turning that faculty learning opportunity into a student learning opportunity as well. I made this point during a conversation with Jon.

MEL-J6: That's a way of saying that, and then also we'll say things to each other, like you and I even in this conversation, and I think in last week's conversation, say things like, "We should do something together sometime." (208)
JON 6: Yeah, that's the building interpersonal structures or what ever the word is there. (209)
MEL-J6: And it's clear from that statement that the important thing is, "Hey, I wanna do something with you, I kinda don't care what the something is, but I want it to be to you." (210)

The dataset narratives had many examples of faculty needs and values coming through in course design. For instance, Jon's personal interest in sustainability led him to look at design more broadly, and was the motivation for co-teaching an exploratory course on the topic in order to see how the idea could develop. (Jon 1) Alan described his cross-disciplinary background across both photography and the graphic and industrial arts as a way to explain his strong emphasis on aesthetics, which carries over into his teaching. “I think it might vary from faculty member to faculty member how much they place on aesthetics. I'm just saying from my perspective I put a LOT of value on something on how it looks.” (Alan 3, 208)

In many cases, faculty interests interact with student reactions, snowballing from informal engagements into the design of a formal curricular offering. Rob's narrative of the origins of the “Stuff of History” course reflect this. “Stuff of History” was a cross-disciplinary offering between History and Materials Science that was started by Rob and Jon after a serendipitous discovery of how they could work together. In the narrative that follows, notice how Rob's involvement is driven by the interests of the faculty members – he goes from a one-time class visitor to a three-time class visitor to the co-instructor of a new course, driven primarily by a sense of the faculty wanting to continue having fun together.

ROB 1: [Jon and two other faculty]... wanted to bring in a history of technology perspective... They said, "Rob, would you join us?" (214) Coming into their classroom was one of the biggest thrills I had in the first year... (216) [my visit] was supposed to happen once, and it [ended up as] a series of 3 visits. (222) So we ended up on the spot broadening my role a little bit... (223) It was a very early thrill for me that in some ways led me deeper into the idea of interdisciplinary integration which culminated into [teaching an] integrated course with Jon [called] Stuff of History, which was basically saying if we could have that much fun in a few sessions, what could we do with a whole course together? (225)

Of the faculty
-------------------
The identities/philosophies/values of the faculty designing and teaching a course leave imprints on their work. The same course taught by different faculty is not the same course at all; they are interchangeable in the same way that Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman are interchangeable as violin soloists.

DATA: Alan's photography background and valuing of aesthetics influencing his assessment criteria for student work

DATA: Rob's late arrival to history leading to his use of graduate pedagogy for undergrads

DATA: Mark's philosophy of letting students learn on their own leading to his "let them struggle" moments in the classroom

DATA: Jon's undergrad experiences leading to his course designs being an avoidance/wish-fulfillment

“We believe it's a good thing for our students to be able to design and make things,” said Alan. (Alan 3, 170) But where does this belief about what's “good for students” come from? According to Alan, it comes from the interests of the faculty themselves. “Every one of us [on the faculty] is more interested in design than we are in making things... and that's why we're focusing more on the design.” (Alan 3, 170)

This example illustrates something the metanarrative of “for the students” will not admit: faculty already put their own needs and values into the curriculum. Faculty design and choose and position their courses because they also have interests and desires. Faculty might desire to make it clear that they can teach advanced technical classes, or they may feel a particular affinity to teaching first-year students. They may want to learn about a specific topic themselves – how often have we heard the advice to teach a seminar class on a topic as a way to get ourselves to learn it?
