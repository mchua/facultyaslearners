Curricular design is for, by, and of the faculty.

This blurs the distinction between the faculty-self and the curriculum-world.

Surgeon story
----------------
A story may be useful to illustrate this point. Imagine a group of surgeons designing medical equipment They will be using this equipment to perform a certain surgery on a large population of patients. The patients are certainly stakeholders in the equipment design, and their values and needs must be taken into account. For example, the scalpel needs to be sharp and long enough to cut through the right tissues in the human population undergoing surgery; it can't be designed for a mouse or an elephant. Additionally, the operating table needs to be long enough for tall patients to lie down, and sturdy enough to hold heavy patients. Surgical drapes should be designed to account for the patients' cultural values of modesty, and so forth.

However, it would be strange to require all design decisions to be justified solely in terms of patient benefit. Imagine what would happen if the surgeons said “We need the scalpel to be controllable by both left and right-handed people...  because some of the patients are left-handed.” The surgeons are controlling the scalpel, not the patients. The scalpel may indeed need to work for both left-handed and right-handed surgeons, but that's because there are left-handed surgeons – not because there are left-handed patients.

Both surgeon and patient needs and values need to be taken into account when designing the medical equipment. The operating table needs to adjust to the height and girth of the patient, but it also needs to adjust to the height and reach of the doctor. Surgical drapes need to account for patient privacy while giving surgeons access to the body parts they will be working on. It may be useful to see surgeons as a different type of user group than patients, but they are both users. Furthermore, some people may belong to both user groups; some surgeons may also undergo the surgery.

Similarly, while students are users of curriculum, they are not the only users. Faculty  also experience their own curricular designs/environments, and have needs and values that inevitably end up shaping the curricular design, whether we admit it or not.

By the faculty
------------------
The idea of curriculum being "by the faculty" is already part of the metanarrative.

For the faculty
------------------

Mark's anecdote brings up another point: far from only being designers of curricula, faculty also learners themselves. Mark's story about the “thick skin” portrays him as a faculty learner in a context outside of curricular design, namely in the summer leadership institute he had attended. However, faculty are also learners in the context of the curriculum they are designing. Gary illustrates this point:

GARY 3: So, team teaching, that was a big piece to figure out what people understood and what their hot buttons were, and what they felt was the most important pieces, and how to negotiate that to then come up with the best content for the students. (92)

The end goal is to create “the best content for the students.” However, in order to do this, the faculty need to learn several things for themselves. Faculty need to “figure out” things about each other, learn things about their colleagues' triggers and values, and learn negotiation skills. Their needs, values, and learning must  also be taken into account – something the metanarrative of “for the students” ignores.


Of the faculty
-------------------
The identities/philosophies/values of the faculty designing and teaching a course leave imprints on their work. The same course taught by different faculty is not the same course at all; they are interchangeable in the same way that Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman are interchangeable as violin soloists.
