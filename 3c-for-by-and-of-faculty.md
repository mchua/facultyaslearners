Curricular design is for, by, and of the faculty.

This blurs the distinction between the faculty-self and the curriculum-world.

By the faculty
------------------
The idea of curriculum being "by the faculty" is already part of the metanarrative.

For the faculty
------------------

DATA: 130 as a facdev opportunity

DATA: Stuff of History as "let's do this together"

Of the faculty
-------------------
The identities/philosophies/values of the faculty designing and teaching a course leave imprints on their work. The same course taught by different faculty is not the same course at all; they are interchangeable in the same way that Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman are interchangeable as violin soloists.

DATA: Alan's photography background and valuing of aesthetics influencing his assessment criteria for student work

DATA: Rob's late arrival to history leading to his use of graduate pedagogy for undergrads

DATA: Mark's philosophy of letting students learn on their own leading to his "let them struggle" moments in the classroom

DATA: Jon's undergrad experiences leading to his course designs being an avoidance/wish-fulfillment
