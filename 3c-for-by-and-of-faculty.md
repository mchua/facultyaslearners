Curricular design is for, by, and of the faculty.

This blurs the distinction between the faculty-self and the curriculum-world.

By the faculty
------------------
The idea of curriculum being "by the faculty" is already part of the metanarrative.

For the faculty
------------------

Gary: “I’m here because I keep on learning” (#?)

DATA: 130 as a facdev opportunity

DATA: Stuff of History as "let's do this together"

89:LYNN 5: He is absolutely right about the value of biting his tongue/waiting, and he is absolutely brilliant at this.  I've taught with him and watched him.  I think he's tried to coach me, too, but I'm not good at it.  If I'm thinking, I'm talking.  This is something I'm really trying to learn -- to be quiet, to listen, to wait -- but it is not something natural for me AT ALL/ (189)

JON 3: I think I might have been a little too... wrapped up in my own process of learning... Honestly I don't know if I was able to sort through what was going on for students at the time. (92)
121:JON 1: We were there, present, chatting with students on occasion but in terms of facilitating student learning and development and supporting it, I think we were doing a horrible job. (121)

169:JON 6: Here we were in this open studio with a bunch of pin up, bulletin boards and sticky notes, and really not much else, asked to do these mysterious... Asked to facilitate student learning in this domain that was new to us, doing activities that were foreign to us, and I think it was just a little bit of cognitive overload paralyzed us. (169)

Discussing watching how students learn, but using it as a way to help faculty develop, so they can help students learn later
GARY 3: On several occasions, Mark would actually come in and sit in on our class and can make observations on what worked and what didn't work. And then I would do follow-up with Mark after that, 'cause he would make modifications on what we had done, and then he could make comments on what he saw worked after you change things or what didn't work. (72)
MEL-G3: Yeah, Mark did mention that, that he was going back and forth and trying to observe the sections. And it sounds like that was a really good growth experience for him. (73)
GARY 3: Yeah, I think it was. And I found it really meaningful to have those conversations with Mark, because we were also team teaching an upper level class. (74)

Of the faculty
-------------------
The identities/philosophies/values of the faculty designing and teaching a course leave imprints on their work. The same course taught by different faculty is not the same course at all; they are interchangeable in the same way that Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman are interchangeable as violin soloists.

DATA: Alan's photography background and valuing of aesthetics influencing his assessment criteria for student work

DATA: Rob's late arrival to history leading to his use of graduate pedagogy for undergrads

DATA: Mark's philosophy of letting students learn on their own leading to his "let them struggle" moments in the classroom

DATA: Jon's undergrad experiences leading to his course designs being an avoidance/wish-fulfillment

It goes get to the students eventually
-----------------------------------------
This doesn't contradict the "for the students" metanarrative; it can exist alongside it. Faculty learn things, and then they trickle out to students.

A3.txt:94:ALAN 3: I think when we're done teaching this course, the four of us, I think we'll be on the same page as far as design and what it means and what it means for our students. (94)

Example: Berea team teaching 130 so the faculty get on the same page - and eventually it'll improve the education of the students.
