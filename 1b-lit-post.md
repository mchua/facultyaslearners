What are poststructuralism and postmodernism
-----------------------------------------------

Poststructuralism seeks to remain in the chaotic liminal spaces most other paradigms seek to escape, and this study uses tools and language from within the paradigm to help participants and readers stay in the discomfort and “ask questions about what we have not thought to think, about what is most densely invested in our discourse/practices, about what has been muted, repressed, unheard” (Lather, 1991, p. 145).


Tools to think with
---------------------

The poststructural paradigm treats faculty-as-learners as agents working against metanarratives by constantly deconstructing intertextual accounts in a writerly manner. We'll spend the remainder of this subsection unpacking the terminology used in that sentence.

### Readerly and writerly texts

The terms writerly and readerly were coined by Roland Barthes in his 1973 book Le Plaisir du Texte (which the 1975 English translation renders as “The Pleasure of the Text”) in order to refer to the role of a text’s reader. A readerly text treats readers only as readers, passive recipients of knowledge. This may be done through narrative seduction, where authoritative-sounding words make it seem like an author’s interpretation is the only correct one; war propaganda frequently uses this technique. It may also be done through banality, where readers are conditioned to find a text so “ordinary” that they dismiss it with habitual patterns (Bruner, 1991, p. 9-10) such as “Oh, that’s just another woman being oversensitive and emotional.” Mishler’s description of “short-\[circuiting] the problem of meaning” by “suppressing the discourse and assuming shared and standard meanings” (1986, p. 65) is a perfect depiction of banality. 

Regardless of the technique used to render a text readerly, such a text places readers in the epistemological position that Baxter-Magolda calls “following formulas” (2001) and Kegan calls the “third order of consciousness” whereby external voices serve as privileged authorities (1994). In a sense, if expertise is the ability to independently create and navigate within a complex context, readerly texts restrict readers from reaching for higher levels of expertise (S. Dreyfus & H. Dreyfus, 1980) by forcing them to play the role of being "'convinced'" of the author's right to serve as 'The Great Interpreter'" (Lather, 1991, p. 10).

Foucault’s 1969 lecture “What is an Author?” and Umberto Eco’s essay collection titled “The Role of the Reader” (1979) speak out against readerly texts and echo Barthes’ call for the death of the author (1967) and the deliberate exposure of the hermeneutic richness inherent in all texts. Texts that do this are writerly texts, and they demand that readers co-construct meaning with the author as they work through the text, much like a workbook with blank spaces for reflective exercises. In a sense, the writerly text is incomplete unless a reader is actively grappling with it, working as a co-author and using their own context to inform a hermeneutics of suspicion. Barthes’ key insight was that all texts are writerly. Cavallaro points out that the very word “text” comes from the Latin “texere,” meaning “to weave.” (2001, p. 59). The fabric of texts can be endlessly made and unmade; they aren't closed, finished, or exclusive to one maker. It is simply that some texts pretend to be readerly and make readers forget their own agency, creating an impoverished view of faculty-as-learners.
