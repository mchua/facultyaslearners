What are poststructuralism and postmodernism
-----------------------------------------------

When we try to understand faculty-as-learners from a poststructural perspective, we are not trying to find the “truth” of how they “really are,” as a positivist or post-positivist would. We are not trying to co-construct that truth with them, the way a constructivist might, or “liberate” them into a larger truth, as a critical theorist might. Instead, we simultaneously draw upon and challenge all these intellectual traditions in order to challenge the very idea of a coherent, pragmatic truth. Poststructuralism and postmodernism are paradigms that deliberately resists convergence. When we try to understand faculty-as-learners from this perspective, we seek to stay with them inside the sort of incoherent liminal spaces where most learners are intensely uncomfortable.

Postmodernism and poststructuralism are heavily intertwined movements that share an opposition to positivism and objectivism. Postmodernism is a response to the modernist emphasis on unrelenting “progress” towards a “better” world. Whereas critical theory interrogates the identity of gatekeepers and the notion of who gets to determine what "better" means (CITATION), postmodernism questions the very concept of a single, infinitely extendable “better." It “denies itself the solace of good forms” and “searches for new presentations, not in order to enjoy them but in order to impart a stronger sense of the unpresentable” (Lyotard, 1984, p. 81).

(Unpack this section more; postmodernism is sort of like the action arm of poststructuralism, the two are different but can't be cleanly separated.)

Tools to think with
---------------------

This project uses tools and language from within the "post-" paradigms to help participants and readers stay in the discomfort and “ask questions about what we have not thought to think, about what is most densely invested in our discourse/practices, about what has been muted, repressed, unheard” (Lather, 1991, p. 145).

The poststructural paradigm treats faculty-as-learners as agents working against metanarratives by constantly deconstructing intertextual accounts in a writerly manner. We'll spend the remainder of this subsection unpacking the terminology used in that sentence.

### Rejecting metanarratives and demolishing binaries

Postmodernism rejects metanarratives; poststructuralism deconstructs binaries and other forms of systematic categorization. Both of these are techniques to interrogate the simple notion of “truth” in order to admit multiplicities of perspectives.

Metanarratives are narratives that are totalizing. Metanarratives try to explain everything, but are themselves ahistorical and acultural, typically falling into readerly mode to gloss over their own socially constructed nature and any history of accepted thought that conflicts. “This is the truth,” they say. “This is how it’s always been.” 

Poststructuralists critique binary oppositions because they "freeze" that shifting and can create false dichotomies that make readers forget they have the writerly power to restructure their world: “Will you pass that student or fail them?” “Neither; I can talk with them about taking an incomplete, substituting other work for the project they didn’t finish, and a whole host of other options.” Lather depicts the goal of deconstruction as “neither unitary wholeness nor dialectical resolution.” Instead, deconstruction seeks to “keep things in process, to disrupt, to keep the system in play, to set up procedures to continuously demystify the realities we create, to fight the tendency for our categories to congeal” (Lather, 1991, p. 13). It tugs at us to stay in the liminal spaces where we are learning.

### Readerly and writerly texts

The terms writerly and readerly were coined by Roland Barthes in his 1973 book Le Plaisir du Texte (which the 1975 English translation renders as “The Pleasure of the Text”) in order to refer to the role of a text’s reader. A readerly text treats readers only as readers, passive recipients of knowledge. This may be done through narrative seduction, where authoritative-sounding words make it seem like an author’s interpretation is the only correct one; war propaganda frequently uses this technique. It may also be done through banality, where readers are conditioned to find a text so “ordinary” that they dismiss it with habitual patterns (Bruner, 1991, p. 9-10) such as “Oh, that’s just another woman being oversensitive and emotional.” Mishler’s description of “short-\[circuiting] the problem of meaning” by “suppressing the discourse and assuming shared and standard meanings” (1986, p. 65) is a perfect depiction of banality. 

Regardless of the technique used to render a text readerly, such a text places readers in the epistemological position that Baxter-Magolda calls “following formulas” (2001) and Kegan calls the “third order of consciousness” whereby external voices serve as privileged authorities (1994). In a sense, if expertise is the ability to independently create and navigate within a complex context, readerly texts restrict readers from reaching for higher levels of expertise (S. Dreyfus & H. Dreyfus, 1980) by forcing them to play the role of being "'convinced'" of the author's right to serve as 'The Great Interpreter'" (Lather, 1991, p. 10).

Foucault’s 1969 lecture “What is an Author?” and Umberto Eco’s essay collection titled “The Role of the Reader” (1979) speak out against readerly texts and echo Barthes’ call for the death of the author (1967) and the deliberate exposure of the hermeneutic richness inherent in all texts. Texts that do this are writerly texts, and they demand that readers co-construct meaning with the author as they work through the text, much like a workbook with blank spaces for reflective exercises. In a sense, the writerly text is incomplete unless a reader is actively grappling with it, working as a co-author and using their own context to inform a hermeneutics of suspicion. Barthes’ key insight was that all texts are writerly. Cavallaro points out that the very word “text” comes from the Latin “texere,” meaning “to weave.” (2001, p. 59). The fabric of texts can be endlessly made and unmade; they aren't closed, finished, or exclusive to one maker. It is simply that some texts pretend to be readerly and make readers forget their own agency, creating an impoverished view of faculty-as-learners.

Deconstruction is not a verb that we as agents execute on a text as object; rather, it is something that we notice the text has always done to itself. (Derrida, 1998; Cavallaro, 2001, p. 26). When we deconstruct a text, we make our world more writerly because we see texts as shifting, changing things.

### Signs and signifiers

(Define signs and signifiers.)

Sign systems such as language — including the language we use to tell the stories that become part of our community’s narrative accruals — have a social dimension, with a multivocal, constantly shifting quality that theorists working with cognitive apprenticeship and community of practice frameworks occasionally give a nod to, but do not typically explore in as much depth as poststructuralists. Communities use sign systems to “[chop] up the continuum of space and time into categories” that then compose their reality. This chopping varies wildly between (and even within) communities; when we marvel at the many words Eskimos fit within our single concept of “snow,” we are noticing their creation of a cultural reality with a different fragmentation than our own (Cavallaro, 2001, p. 17).

When we understand the rhetoric of the community of practice that our cognitive apprenticeships are enculturating us into, we also come to understand the dominant ideology mirrored by that rhetoric. For instance, Greco-Roman ideology valued a rhetoric of clear public oration, whereas Renaissance ideology valued a rhetoric of private communications that danced around a point rather than making it directly; the cultural assumptions of each community are reflected in the ways they privileged certain usages of language (p. 30-31).

### Reading people and environments as texts

Poststructuralists also expose the privilege our communities grant to things that can be signified by signs, pointing to feelings, silences, and other things we deem as “real” but cannot express directly. The teaching practices of cognitive apprenticeships — modeling, coaching, scaffolding, and so forth — are tools that can be used to “impart a stronger sense of the unpresentable” (Lyotard, 1984, p. 81) and enculturate learners into a way of being that cannot be fully articulated with signs. Cognitive apprentices are not just “reading” texts composed of written or spoken words; they are reading the entire world around them all the time (Cavallaro, 2001, p. 49). As learners become more fluent at decoding the signs they are surrounded by, they improve their ability to make sense of a complex context; this ability, as we have mentioned earlier, is also known as mastery (S. Dreyfus & H. Dreyfus, 1980).

A poststructural adaptation of communities of practice sees community members — including apprentice members — as texts, since the people are part of the surrounding sign-system those apprentices work to decode. This draws upon Stanley Fish's idea that “readers are readable” (1980) and Alberto Manguel’s idea that humans are books to be read (1997). In short, readers are produced by their culture as “texts” whose meanings are determined by their communities. In a similar way, texts also become readers because "they expect to be read in ways sanctioned by the community and thus read us as we read them, i.e. monitor our ability to employ the interpretive skills we are supposed to have developed" (Cavallaro, 2001). A common example in academia is the difficult “classic” paper that graduate students are expected to read “in ways sanctioned by the community” until they can use it to display the “interpretative skills” they “are supposed to have developed.” We transform writerly texts by reading them; texts transform us by reading us “as we read them.”

### Intertextuality and intersubjectivity
