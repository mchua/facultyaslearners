Language collisions are evidence of, and opportunity for, faculty as learners.

This points out the fluidity of the curriculum (world).

Language collisions happen because different selves in dialogue have different perspectives.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Different selves might mean different selves in time, different individuals, or different groups.

Of course they're different perspectives; varied backgrounds and goals mean the same word carries different connotations.

Since language is a hermeneutical process, we can't magically diff and patch our language to be identical; we're always making sense of what we think is the meaning of the other.

We can respond to differences in language prescriptively in an attempt to enforce alignment.

We can respond to differences in language descriptively in an attempt to clarify in hindsight.

Different perspectives are an opportunity to expand and modify one's repertoire of perspectives.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We choose how to frame the value of these language differences and the effort spent on their articulation and resolution.
--------------------------------------

Is this signal, or is this noise? Is it valued work, or inconvenience better avoided if possible?

Do we expect ourselves to immediately be able to articulate our learning, and the differences between our learning and the learning of others?

Language differences are indicators and probes what opportunities we may have to learn from each other.
