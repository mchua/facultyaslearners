Curricular design and teaching iterations are evidence of and sites for faculty learning; hiding the iterations hides the learning.

This interrogates the fluidity of the world in contrast with the way faculty present it.

Iterations are learning.
--------------------------

DATA: Instances of "first time" teaching described as making a mess (Alan re: 130)

DATA: Instances of teaching courses more than once and "getting better" at it (Mark: first time through for Daniel)

DATA: Lynn -- eventually we figured out what we were doing with UOCD.

DATA: Jon and Rob -- iterations on Stuff of History

DATA: Lynn -- when we designed E4H, we designed it "correctly" from the start.

Iterations can be seen as noise.
------------------------------------------------------------------

DATA: Gary - "it's messy/distracting"

DATA: Lynn -- "thank goodness we know what we're doing now"

When we package for others, we exclude the noise.
----------------------------------------------------

DATA: Gary - hopes of passing on 130 to a new faculty member

DATA: Jon and Rob - reverse-engineering the process for faculty workshops

DATA: Jon on packaging

And yet this noise can also be seen as signal.
-------------------------------------------------

It's possible we may want to learn from it in the future, since we're never "done" learning from a story.

Narratives are the nice stories we tell in hindsight. If we knew the story before we lived it, we wouldn't have gone on the journey; we would already have arrived at the destination.
