(This section should talk about the role of poststructural narrative in unpacking faculty learning.

* What is narrative, and how does it show learning?
* How does narrative show up in a faculty context? (How has it been used to study faculty in the past, as learners or otherwise?)
* What do our poststructural tools do to narrative? How will we be employing each poststructural tool in order to understand faculty narratives in a different light (compared to what?)

A poststructural view of narrative
------------------------------------

Poststructuralism does not reject narratives; rather, it embraces them as texts in different ways. The emphasis on narrative agency and the use of personal history still makes narrative valuable as a tool for exploring the idea of faculty-as-learners. However, we no longer see these narratives or the process of creating them as positivist “mirrors” reflecting the “true” world. We do not even see them as constructivist “lamps” from within the narrator’s mind radiating light on their personal perceptions of “truth” (Abrams, 1953). 

Poststructural narratives aren't about the convergence of "truth" or even the attempt to create what Wikipedia calls a "neutral point of view" (CITATION), which is the metanarrative that says "there are many possible narratives for this space, and we have listed them below in an objective and reasonably complete fashion." "Neutral point of view" assumes a stable external point of reference by which “truth” can be calibrated and correlated. It implies a stance of having stepped outside of subjectivity -- "each of the people in their own little stories there can only see so much of the world, but I, compiling all these perspectives, can clearly see them all; my perspective is uniquely unmarked by subjectivity." 

There is no perspective and no statement that goes unmarked by subjectivity. Even ordinary language is full of rhetoric and marked by the slippage of meaning (Derrida, 1998). For instance, we tell students to “take a course” that will “move them closer to graduation,” but do not literally mean that a “course” is something to physically take hold of, or that it will bodily convey them to a physical location of “graduation.”

Instead, the poststructuralist view of narrative (and all other) texts is that they are collections of signs that “do not embody specific meanings or concepts” and only “ become meaningful when they are decoded according to cultural conventions.” (Cavallaro, 2001, p. 15-16).

Critiquing metanarratives in academia
--------------------------------------------

(Do I need to set up the academic context first so we know where these metanarratives come from, perhaps putting the context part before the poststructural and narrative sections?)

The culture of college and university faculty, like all cultures, has metanarratives; they are convenient shorthands used to align activity and thought. Grand, sweeping metanarratives of continuous improvement hold out a tempting promise of certainty in a better future. Common academic metanarratives include:

(LIST OF COMMON ACADEMIC METANARRATIVES, WITH CITATIONS)

* if everybody goes to college, our country would be great!
* if all professors taught with hands-on projects rather than lectures, college teaching would be excellent!

Postmodernism exemplifies an “incredulity towards metanarratives” (Lyotard, 1984, p. xxiv), arguing against totality and for a multiplicity of competing ideas that do not layer neatly atop each other.
This is a view consonant with statements by scholars on the importance of academic freedom and intellectual dissent. (CITATION) Humboldt said (QUOTE BY HUMBOLDT ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM) and Boyer said (QUOTE BY BOYER ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM). More recently, (MODERN QUOTES ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND INTELLECTUAL DISSENT.)

Lyotard’s argument against totality and for multiplicity is a binary (X vs. Y), which is itself rejected by poststructuralism in a tongue-in-cheek binary opposition. Just as postmodernism helps us understand faculty-as-learners by rejecting the modernist notion of a metanarrative of “truth” that they must live within, poststructuralism helps us understand faculty-as-learners by rejecting the “structuralist dream of producing scientific accounts of culture by discovering its underlying sign systems” (Cavallaro, 2001, p. 25), or the objectivism-tinged idea that we can find or co-construct the way things “really work.”

Writerly access to narrative accruals
------------------------------------------

Jerome Bruner assserted that all narratives are hermeneutically composed (1991, p. 7). This statement from the narrative perspective has a poststructuralist parallel: “All texts are writerly.” 

The forgetting-of-agency has an unfortunate effect on narrative accruals, the collection of stories that a community shares. If a practitioner is only exposed to readerly texts in their field, they are likely to view their field in a readerly way. However, a practitioner cannot co-author a community’s narrative accrual without first viewing the texts as writerly, and that sort of co-authorship is a key part of becoming a full member of a community of practice. Likewise, placing one’s own personal narrative within the narrative accrual of one’s field is a highly writerly act that helps both with sense-making of identity at a personal level and cultural transformation at the community level. It’s the difference between passively watching a professional basketball game and going home thinking “I’ll never be that good, so why try?” and being inspired by the same game to get out there and play basketball with your friends so that you all improve your game. By making-visible the underlying writerly nature of texts, faculty-as-learners become conscious of how they are already crafting the narratives of their teaching identities. More importantly, they are viewed as learners who recognize and actualize their agency to analyze and edit and shape not only their own stories, but each other’s.
