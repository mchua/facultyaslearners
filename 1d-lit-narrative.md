(This section should talk about the role of poststructural narrative in unpacking faculty learning.

* What is narrative, and how does it show learning?
* How does narrative show up in a faculty context? (How has it been used to study faculty in the past, as learners or otherwise?)
* What do our poststructural tools do to narrative? How will we be employing each poststructural tool in order to understand faculty narratives in a different light (compared to what?)

A poststructural view of narrative
------------------------------------

### Narratives are no longer about convergence on "truth"

Poststructuralism does not reject narratives; rather, it embraces them as texts in different ways. The emphasis on narrative agency and the use of personal history still makes narrative valuable as a tool for exploring the idea of faculty-as-learners. However, we no longer see these narratives or the process of creating them as positivist “mirrors” reflecting the “true” world. We do not even see them as constructivist “lamps” from within the narrator’s mind radiating light on their personal perceptions of “truth” (Abrams, 1953). 

Poststructural narratives aren't about the convergence of "truth" or even the attempt to create what Wikipedia calls a "neutral point of view" (CITATION), which is the metanarrative that says "there are many possible narratives for this space, and we have listed them below in an objective and reasonably complete fashion." "Neutral point of view" assumes a stable external point of reference by which “truth” can be calibrated and correlated. It implies a stance of having stepped outside of subjectivity -- "each of the people in their own little stories there can only see so much of the world, but I, compiling all these perspectives, can clearly see them all; my perspective is uniquely unmarked by subjectivity." 

### Narratives only have meaning in context

Instead, the poststructuralist view of narrative (and all other) texts is that they are collections of signs that “do not embody specific meanings or concepts” and only “ become meaningful when they are decoded according to cultural conventions.” (Cavallaro, 2001, p. 15-16). (POSSIBLY EXPAND DISCUSSION TO COVER ACADEMIC CULTURE, AS EXPLAINED EARLIER?)

There is no perspective and no statement that goes unmarked by subjectivity. Even ordinary language is full of rhetoric and marked by the slippage of meaning (Derrida, 1998). For instance, we tell students to “take a course” that will “move them closer to graduation,” but do not literally mean that a “course” is something to physically take hold of, or that it will bodily convey them to a physical location of “graduation.”

### Narratives must interrupt themselves for reflection

A poststructuralist approach to faculty narratives is one that frequently interrupts itself to examine itself, and thus expects the role of faculty-as-learner to include a high degree of reflection-in-action (Schön, 1983). This has direct methodological implications. Interactions that might be considered "out of bounds" for a "neutral" interviewer/interviewee setup, such as probes that admit interviewer experiences and opinions, are now not only allowed, but explicitly required.

Critiquing metanarratives in academia
--------------------------------------------

(Do I need to set up the academic context first so we know where these metanarratives come from, perhaps putting the context part before the poststructural and narrative sections?)

The culture of college and university faculty, like all cultures, has metanarratives; they are convenient shorthands used to align activity and thought. Grand, sweeping metanarratives of continuous improvement hold out a tempting promise of certainty in a better future. Common academic metanarratives include:

(LIST OF COMMON ACADEMIC METANARRATIVES, WITH CITATIONS)

* if everybody goes to college, our country would be great!
* if all professors taught with hands-on projects rather than lectures, college teaching would be excellent!

Postmodernism exemplifies an “incredulity towards metanarratives” (Lyotard, 1984, p. xxiv), arguing against totality and for a multiplicity of competing ideas that do not layer neatly atop each other.
This is a view consonant with statements by scholars on the importance of academic freedom and intellectual dissent. (CITATION) Humboldt said (QUOTE BY HUMBOLDT ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM) and Boyer said (QUOTE BY BOYER ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM). More recently, (MODERN QUOTES ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND INTELLECTUAL DISSENT.)

Lyotard’s argument against totality and for multiplicity is a binary (X vs. Y), which is itself rejected by poststructuralism in a tongue-in-cheek binary opposition. Just as postmodernism helps us understand faculty-as-learners by rejecting the modernist notion of a metanarrative of “truth” that they must live within, poststructuralism helps us understand faculty-as-learners by rejecting the “structuralist dream of producing scientific accounts of culture by discovering its underlying sign systems” (Cavallaro, 2001, p. 25), or the objectivism-tinged idea that we can find or co-construct the way things “really work.”

Writerly access to narrative accruals
------------------------------------------

Jerome Bruner assserted that all narratives are hermeneutically composed (1991, p. 7). This statement from the narrative perspective has a poststructuralist parallel: “All texts are writerly.” 

The forgetting-of-agency has an unfortunate effect on narrative accruals, the collection of stories that a community shares. If a practitioner is only exposed to readerly texts in their field, they are likely to view their field in a readerly way. However, a practitioner cannot co-author a community’s narrative accrual without first viewing the texts as writerly, and that sort of co-authorship is a key part of becoming a full member of a community of practice. Likewise, placing one’s own personal narrative within the narrative accrual of one’s field is a highly writerly act that helps both with sense-making of identity at a personal level and cultural transformation at the community level. It’s the difference between passively watching a professional basketball game and going home thinking “I’ll never be that good, so why try?” and being inspired by the same game to get out there and play basketball with your friends so that you all improve your game. By making-visible the underlying writerly nature of texts, faculty-as-learners become conscious of how they are already crafting the narratives of their teaching identities. More importantly, they are viewed as learners who recognize and actualize their agency to analyze and edit and shape not only their own stories, but each other’s.

Faculty learners as poststructural narrators
----------------------------------------------

Having introduced the ideas of “readers as texts” and “texts as readers,” we can now describe faculty as learners who simultaneously negotiate both roles. From this perspective, faculty-as-learners can be seen as readers/texts that constantly and mutually re-author and re-present each other, themselves, and the narrative accruals of their communities. This is a high-agency role that requires the faculty narrator/apprentice to draw extensively on both their present context and their past history in order to expose and work within a writerly world. It is a stark contrast to the “information dissemination” view of faculty-as-learners as mere recipients and measurable end-objects in someone else’s project.

“Mutually re-authoring and re-presenting” may sound like a more complicated version of the phrase “they co-construct each other,” and, in a sense, it is. However, the sign “co-construction” usually signifies an attempt to converge, even temporarily, on a single viewpoint. Even statements of the type that “there are many viewpoints; historically, some people have viewed this as X, others as Y, and yet others as Z” is itself based on a single viewpoint that is known on Wikipedia as neutral point of view (NPOV). Its rhetoric of claiming to represent "fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic,” mirrors a certain unspoken ideology of what qualifies as a “significant view” or “reliable source” (Wikipedia, 2014). In contrast, the poststructural viewpoint casts faculty narrator/apprentices and their narratives as “polyphonic texts that challenge dominant ideologies by articulating diverse discourses… thus resisting the notion of a unified viewpoint” (Cavallaro, 2001, p. 19).

The resulting accrual of both narrations and narrators also displays intertextuality, the idea that texts “always absorb and transform other texts” and “can be thought of as a tapestry of quotations, a mosaic of allusions” (p. 60). One famous example of intertextuality in action is T.S. Eliot’s poem “The Waste Land” (Eliot, 2000), which consists largely of allusions to other literary works. Another example of intertextuality is a scholarly document such as this one. When I quote Cavallaro as saying that “if texts are intertextual, subjective responses to texts are intersubjective,” I use her signifier of “intersubjectivity” in order to contextualize my thoughts (1991, p. 60).

Since the sign “intersubjectivity” is likely to be unfamiliar to many of my readers, I must employ repetition to re-present the concept in greater detail so that my readers are able to make sense of the new word. Intersubjectivity refers to the interactions between interpretations proposed by multiple people. Intertextuality is about the interweaving of texts in the same way intersubjectivity is about the interweaving of interpretations. For instance, a conversation between faculty members reflecting on a shared experience is intersubjective; although their interpretations of the experience may not ultimately converge, their interpretations will interact and change during the course of the discussion. To draw an even more specific example, the responses of a committee to a dissertation proposal are intersubjective. Each committee member reading the proposal goes through the process of interpreting the document for themselves, but their interpretation interacts with the interpretations of the other committee members and the graduate student author. The interaction of these interpretations takes place within the conventions of a particular community of practice — in this case, the community of engineering education researchers. Based on these culturally-shaped interactions, the interpretations of particular community members may be accepted or rejected.

By defining intersubjectivity, I am engaging in a reflexive interruption and deconstruction of my own text, revealing my own authorship, and encouraging the reader (you!) to see this document as a writerly text to freely interpret and make sense of. None of the ideas introduced in this section of the document are particularly new; what I’m trying to do is to give you a language you can use to discuss and become more aware of how these dynamics already play out in the lives of faculty. All the same, the process of acquiring poststructural language is often an uncomfortable process for the reader, who may not be used to authors breaking the fourth wall. For this discomfort, I apologize. However, this boundary-blurring is typical of the poststructural approach of “deni\[ying]… the solace of good forms” (Lyotard, 1984, p. 81) in order to get readers to examine their expectations of how texts ought to perform.
