(This section should talk about the role of poststructural narrative in unpacking faculty learning.

* What is narrative, and how does it show learning?
* How does narrative show up in a faculty context? (How has it been used to study faculty in the past, as learners or otherwise?)
* What do our poststructural tools do to narrative? How will we be employing each poststructural tool in order to understand faculty narratives in a different light (compared to what?)

Writerly access to narrative accruals
------------------------------------------

Jerome Bruner assserted that all narratives are hermeneutically composed (1991, p. 7). This statement from the narrative perspective has a poststructuralist parallel: “All texts are writerly.” 

The forgetting-of-agency has an unfortunate effect on narrative accruals, the collection of stories that a community shares. If a practitioner is only exposed to readerly texts in their field, they are likely to view their field in a readerly way. However, a practitioner cannot co-author a community’s narrative accrual without first viewing the texts as writerly, and that sort of co-authorship is a key part of becoming a full member of a community of practice. Likewise, placing one’s own personal narrative within the narrative accrual of one’s field is a highly writerly act that helps both with sense-making of identity at a personal level and cultural transformation at the community level. It’s the difference between passively watching a professional basketball game and going home thinking “I’ll never be that good, so why try?” and being inspired by the same game to get out there and play basketball with your friends so that you all improve your game. By making-visible the underlying writerly nature of texts, faculty-as-learners become conscious of how they are already crafting the narratives of their teaching identities. More importantly, they are viewed as learners who recognize and actualize their agency to analyze and edit and shape not only their own stories, but each other’s.
