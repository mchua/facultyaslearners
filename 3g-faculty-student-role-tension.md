There is a tension regarding the distinction between faculty as learners and students as learners, and how those people author the curriculum.

This interrogates the boundary between faculty "self" and student "other."

The curriculum is for, by, and of students.
---------------------------------------------------

If faculty inherit students as part of their curriculum, students are also part of the curriculum. Curriculum is by, for, and of the students.

We already know that "for the students" is part of the metanarrative.

It is also by and of students; they bring in their own interests, hopes, dreams, and learning from prior experiences.

Other examples include independent studies, clubs with invited faculty advisors, doctoral dissertations, and any other project where the student determines the curriculum and the faculty member follows the student's lead and acts as a coach.

Another example is the experience of teaching different sections of the "same" class.

Applying the transitive property means faculty blur with students
------------------------------------------------------------------

If faculty are the curriculum they teach and learn from, and students are the curriculum they teach and learn from, then we're left with questions about the distinction between faculty and students. Do they teach and learn from the curriculum in different ways? Do they embody the curriculum in different ways? Do they blur the boundaries between themselves and the curriculum in different ways? Do they construct and get constructed by the curriculum in different ways?

These questions trouble our conceptions of ourselves as faculty. What does it mean to be a faculty member, and what does this mean for how we relate to students?

This tension shows up in discussions on the role of students in curricular design.

DATA: Lynn's response

DATA: Jon's response

DATA: Rob's response

All these responses exhibit that tension; students can somehow contribute, but somehow it's also different from what faculty can contribute. The clarity of those "somehows" is variant and slipping.

When we allow ourselves to shift, blur, add, and remove Bohrian cuts around these assemblages, we open up different possibilities for teaching and learning for everyone.

DATA: Rob on feedback

This story is entirely different framed in the metanarrative of "for the students." Rob's example shows him shifting his feedback activities from something very much within that metanarrative -- to something that is now outside of it.
